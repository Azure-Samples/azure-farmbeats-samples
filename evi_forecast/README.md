This project consists of five notebooks:

| Notebook | Description |  
| --- | --- |
| [1_download_data.ipynb](1_download_data.ipynb) | This notebook demonstrates how to download satellite and weather data for given boundaries to buidl EVI forecast model.
| [2_train.ipynb](2_train.ipynb) | This notebook demonstrates building end to end deep learning model using satellite and weather data.
| [3_test.ipynb](3_test.ipynb) | In this notebook, model forecasts EVI for next 10 days for an 'Area of Interest' (AOI).
| [4_deploy_azure.ipynb](4_deploy_azure.ipynb) | This notebook demonstrates how to deploy model and create webservice using Azure ML SDK.
| [5_inference.ipynb](5_inference.ipynb) | This notebook demonstrates model inference on a new AOI using model webserive endpoint and generate EVI forecast for next 10 days in advance.
